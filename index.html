                            Now I'm studying in my third year at BSUIR. In the first and second years of studying at university, I wrote and defended two courseworks in C++. In the third year I was working on and successfully defended coursework in Java. In the near future, I want to become a skillful programmer and a highly-professional specialist. My goal is to find a job this year and I am looking forward to gaining valuable experience on a real project with the team. I consider myself to be a hardworking and enthusiastic person, I am always ready to learn something new.
